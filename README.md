# cringe-chinese-anki-card-format

I am not a frontend "developer" so please forgive me idk how to write html O_o

I don't think theres any standard way to share your card templates other than sharing a whole deck, so you can just copy the code into your own card. 


Here's basically what the cards do. 
I use yomichan setup for chinese ([check out this amazing guide](https://gist.github.com/shoui520/25460fd2e9fb194d3e5152fa2ce42ca2)) to fill out every field except for picture and notes 

Card 1
frontside:
- the full sentence audio

backside: 
- target word hanzi (which links to its mdgb page)
- target word pinyin
- target word audio (scraped from forvo)
- picture (screenshotted while mining)
- notes ~ optional to increast comprehensability or clarify something


Card 2
frontside:
- target word hanzi

backside:
- same as card 1 backside but the target word hanzi is up top
